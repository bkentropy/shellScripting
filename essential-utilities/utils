cut -f1 filename // should cut the first field from filename
// I find awk '{print $1}' filename works better

paste file1 file2 // joins the first lines of each 

join file1 file2 // combines fields that match into file column and then
appends the other fields
// Note that join will only work, if there is a common field in both files and
// if values are identical to each other.

// example using sname
tr "h2" "3x" < sname
// The first field are the characters to be replaced and 
// the second field is the characters to translate over the first field

// this will only return lines (or fields?) that are unique from a thought
uniq filename

// this will only return lines (or fields) and they will be sorted
sort filename

// will return all of the "strings" that matchs the given pattern from filename
grep 'pattern' filename
